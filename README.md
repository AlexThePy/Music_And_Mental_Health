# Music_And_Mental_Health
Exploring the relationship between music therapy (MT) and mental health.

# **Description**
  The MxMH (Music and Mental Health) dataset focuses on exploring the relationship between music therapy (MT) and mental health. MT, recognized as an evidence-based practice, leverages music to enhance individuals' stress levels, mood, and overall mental health, often stimulating the release of 'happy' hormones like oxytocin. The uniqueness of MT lies in its diverse range of genres, which vary significantly across different organizations.

## **Objective**
  The primary aim of the MxMH dataset is to investigate potential correlations between an individual's music habits and their self-reported mental health. This exploration could reveal significant insights into how music influences mental health, leading to more effective applications of MT. Such findings can also provide broader insights into the intricate relationships between music, mood, and mental well-being.

  The analysis of this dataset will focus on identifying patterns and correlations, which could potentially inform and refine the practice of MT. By understanding the specific musical preferences that positively impact mental health, practitioners can tailor MT sessions more effectively to individual needs.
