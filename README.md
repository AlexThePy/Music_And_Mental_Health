# Music_And_Mental_Health
Exploring the relationship between music therapy (MT) and mental health.

# **Description**
  The MxMH (Music and Mental Health) dataset focuses on exploring the relationship between music therapy (MT) and mental health. MT, recognized as an evidence-based practice, leverages music to enhance individuals' stress levels, mood, and overall mental health, often stimulating the release of 'happy' hormones like oxytocin. The uniqueness of MT lies in its diverse range of genres, which vary significantly across different organizations.

## **Objective**
  The primary aim of the MxMH dataset is to investigate potential correlations between an individual's music habits and their self-reported mental health. This exploration could reveal significant insights into how music influences mental health, leading to more effective applications of MT. Such findings can also provide broader insights into the intricate relationships between music, mood, and mental well-being.

  The analysis of this dataset will focus on identifying patterns and correlations, which could potentially inform and refine the practice of MT. By understanding the specific musical preferences that positively impact mental health, practitioners can tailor MT sessions more effectively to individual needs.

## **Dataset**

This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results
  
## **Research Results**

These are some main examples after performing data analysis on the dataset.

**Based on the mean frequency scores, here are the most to least popular music genres among the survey respondents:**

Rock: 2.07
Pop: 2.03
Hip hop: 1.38
Classical: 1.34
Rap: 1.34
R&B: 1.26
Video game music: 1.25
Metal: 1.22
Lofi: 1.07
Jazz: 1.03
EDM: 1.02
Folk: 1.01
Country: 0.82
K pop: 0.74
Latin: 0.61
Gospel: 0.38

**The correlation matrix indicates how each genre of music is correlated with the psychological factors of Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, and OCD. Here are some observations based on the calculated correlations:**

Frequency [Classical]: Shows a very small negative correlation with Anxiety, a negligible correlation with Depression, a slightly positive correlation with Insomnia, and a negligible correlation with OCD.

Frequency [Country]: Very small negative correlation with Depression, small negative correlation with Insomnia, and a small positive correlation with OCD, with no significant correlation with Anxiety.

Frequency [EDM]: Shows positive correlations with all psychological factors, most notably with Depression and OCD.

Frequency [Metal]: Has a notably higher positive correlation with Depression and Insomnia compared to other genres.

Frequency [Rock]: Also shows a higher positive correlation with Depression, and to a lesser extent with Anxiety and Insomnia.

Frequency [Video game music]: Has moderate positive correlations with Anxiety, Depression, and Insomnia.

It's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. These correlations simply indicate that there is a relationship between the frequency of listening to these genres and the psychological factors, but they don't tell us anything about which causes the other, or if there's a third factor influencing both.
